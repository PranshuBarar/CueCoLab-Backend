## Introduction
I coded 15 hours/day for 3 months and developed a SaaS product, CueCoLab, to address specific challenges in the content creation industry. Check it out here: [CueCoLab](https://cuecolab.com).

## Problems Faced by Content Creators
Content creators, especially YouTube channel owners, encounter several issues:
- **Connectivity Issues:** Frequent traveling often leads to poor internet connectivity, making it difficult to download and upload large video files.
- **Security Concerns:** Reluctance to provide direct editing access to others due to security risks.
- **Inefficiency:** The need to manually download and upload videos is time-consuming and cumbersome.

## Solutions Provided by CueCoLab
CueCoLab addresses these challenges through:
- **Intermediate Platform:** Editors can upload videos directly to CueCoLab Room.
- **Video Pre-upload Playback:** Channel owners can review videos on CueCoLab before final upload.
- **YouTube Integration:** Direct publishing to YouTube via CueCoLab using YouTubeâ€™s API.
- **Control and Security:** Channel owner retains full control with approval required for each video.
- **Notification System:** Upcoming feature to approve uploads remotely without direct file handling.

## Benefits of Using CueCoLab
Using CueCoLab offers significant advantages:
- **Efficiency:** Drastically cuts down the time needed for managing video uploads.
- **Security:** Ensures that uploads are fully authorized.
- **Convenience:** Facilitates remote management of content, ideal for travel and poor connectivity.

## Development Journey
Starting on March 11th, 2024, my journey began with learning front-end development from scratch:
- **Skill Acquisition:** From JavaScript to advanced frameworks like Next.js with TypeScript.
- **Design and Prototyping:** Initial sketches to final design iterations on Canva.
- **Back-end and Front-end Development:** Building a robust back-end using Spring Boot and crafting an interactive front-end.

## Technical Challenges
- **Video Transcoding and Streaming:** Implemented using ffmpeg and AWS services for cost-effective, scalable solutions.
- **Secured HLS Streaming:** Achieved with CloudFront's signed URLs after overcoming challenges with signed cookies.
- **Direct YouTube Uploads:** Utilized YouTube Data API to facilitate uploads directly from CueCoLab.

## Technology Stack
**Frontend:**
1. Next.js over React with TypeScript
2. Tailwind CSS and MaterialUI

**Backend:**
1. Spring Boot
2. Spring Security

**Cloud (AWS):**
1. CloudFront
2. ECS (Fargate)
3. EventBridge
4. SQS
5. S3
6. Lambda

## Architectures Used
I implemented several AWS architectures involving ECS Fargate, EventBridge, and more. <!-- If you have images, you can insert them here. -->
